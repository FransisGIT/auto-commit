# GitHub Profile Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for showcasing my GitHub profile. It is designed to present key information, projects, and updates in an organized and visually appealing manner.

## Features
- **Automated Updates**: Uses GitHub Actions to keep the profile up-to-date with the latest changes.
- **Dynamic Commit Messages**: Generates meaningful and random commit messages to simulate regular activity.
- **Scheduled Commits**: Commits are scheduled at specific times to maintain consistent activity on the profile.

## Automated Workflow
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Modifies the `LAST_UPDATED` file with the current timestamp.
2. Commits the changes with a random, human-like message.
3. Pushes the changes to the remote repository.

### Schedule
The workflow runs 10 times daily, starting at 07:00 WIB (00:00 UTC) and repeating every hour until 16:00 WIB (09:00 UTC).

## Technologies Used
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating commits and updates.
- **Bash Scripts**: To handle file updates and commit messages.

## Example Commit Messages
- `feat: updated latest data`
- `chore: automated update for files`
- `fix: minor adjustment in configuration`
- `refactor: improved file structure`
- `docs: updated last updated timestamp`

## How It Works
1. The workflow is triggered based on the defined schedule in the `cron` settings.
2. It updates the `LAST_UPDATED` file with the current timestamp.
3. A commit message is randomly selected from a predefined list.
4. The changes are pushed to the `master` branch of this repository.
